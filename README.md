# EV3-Classroom
The LabVIEW tool is now replace with the EV3 Classroom that is based on the MIT scratch design. This repository is for the training material used in WVPL 2022 Amazing Maze season.

The training is using the old EV3 robots build in the 2020 season using the MS MakeCode tool. The robot uses the standard 26.7 mm wheels (motors B and C) with 160 mm track width. In front of the robot, there is a catcher (motor D) that is mechanically connected to a touch sensor (port 1) for zero point reset. On the left side there is a color sensor (port 3). On the right side there is a ultrasound distance sensor (port 4) looking to right. Any EV3 with these specifications can be used with the code in this repository.
