# EV3-Classroom
This is a new tool from LEGO Education business to program the EV3 Mindstorms robot. It replaces the LabVIEW tool that has been used since the release of EV3.  The EV3 Classroom is based on the MIT scratch design. Its functionality is similar with the LEGO Spike Prime and LEGO Robot Inventor tools.

## Amazing Maze
This repository is for the training material used in WVPL 2022 Amazing Maze season.

The training uses the old EV3 robots build from the WPL 2020 season when the MS MakeCode tool was used. The robot has the standard 26.7 mm wheels (motors B and C) with 160 mm track width. In front of the robot, there is a catcher (motor D) that is mechanically connected to a touch sensor (port 1) for zero point reset. On the left side there is a color sensor (port 3). On the right side there is a ultrasound distance sensor (port 4) looking to right. Any EV3 with these specifications can be used with the code in this repository.
