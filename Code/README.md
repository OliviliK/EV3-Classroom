# EV3 Classroom Code
The Classroom projects are stored in LMSP files (LEGO Mindstorms Project). They are technically ZIP files and can be opened with any ZIP tool once the extension is changed to ZIP.

The folder content in the ZIP file is
* icon.svg for the image of the program
* manifest.jsn for project configuration
* scratch.sb3 for the scratch content

If the SB3 file extension is changed to ZIP, its content can be seen as
* resource files for images and sounds
* project.json file for scratch configuration

## Project File Names in Code Folder
The first part indicates the lesson number. The second part describes the project functionality.

## File Sizes
All project layouts are so small that they do fit on a single laptop screen. If looked with a smaller tablet, some scrolling is required.

## Copy Operation
The current implementation of EV3-Classroom doesn't support copying blocks between project files.  That leaves two usage options
* Use visual copy by manually entering the blocks, variable definitions, and MyBlock definitions
* Use the project as they are and modify them as required

Although, the direct usage as these files is not recommended because it reduces the learning opportunities.  It is OK to manually copy them in case the students do understand the ideas behind the code.
