# EV3 Classroom Code
The Classroom projects are stored in LMSP files. They are technically ZIP files and can be opened with any ZIP tool once the extension is changed to ZIP.

The folder content in the ZIP file is
* icon.svg for the image of the program
* manifest.jsn for project configuration
* scratch.sb3 for the scratch content

If the SB3 file extension is changed to ZIP, its content can be seen as
* resource files for images and sounds
* project.json file for scratch configuration
